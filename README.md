# diffie-hellman-with-fast-modular-exponentiation-
I implemented a Python code that calculates the secret key between two people (Alice and Bob). This process is called Diffie-Hellman key exchange. I build a function called fme (fast modular exponentiation) which calculates: base**exponent % modulus in polynomial time.
